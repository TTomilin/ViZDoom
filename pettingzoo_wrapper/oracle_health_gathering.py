"""
Oracle🔮 for the health gathering scenario.

The oracle has two modes, guided by game-theoretic perspectives:

  "defector"     - every agent walks to its own nearest medkit and takes it on
                   sight, at any health.
  "collaborator" - an agent only obtains a kit once its health has room for
                   the full heal (`consume_health`, 50 by default). Until then,
                   it waits beside the kit. Kits are allocated to whomever
                   runs out of health first. However, this claim is ignored
                   when the owner of this "claim" cannot reach the kit alive.

Waiting is done at arm's length. An agent comfortably parks itself at around
150 units from the selected kit. Note that kits might spawn right in front or
on top of the agent, making a pick-up unavoidable. In these rare circumstances,
even the oracles might have to succumb to the acid floor.

The map is designed to provide a surplus of medkits. For instance, 48 kits will
spawn throughout a 500-step episode with 2 agents. At the wad's current 50
health per kit that is 2400 health on offer, against a collective drain of 1000
health points for the two agents. With reasonable navigation and teamwork,
death should not be an option. In the defector mode, it is a certainty.
